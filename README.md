# Modal Demo

Basic React application that shows off some fun things like Compound-State
Components, Higher-Order Components, localstorage cacheing and some very basic 
Redux integration(which is arguably overkill for this example).

## Getting Started

Clone this directory, run:

`$ npm install && npm start`.

## TODO

- Implement animation via `react-motion`.
- Cleanup remnants of `create-react-app` boilerplate.
